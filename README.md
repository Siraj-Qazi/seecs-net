Simple social network in Laravel.

Web Engineering Semester Project in PHP(Laravel)/HTML5/CSS3/JS.

The default credentials for the Administrator account can be set from the database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php

So it'll be best to seed the database once before starting the local server.

To run:
1. Set up connection to the local/remote SQL database in the .env file
2. Fire up the terminal and run:

$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan seed

3. To start the local server at http://127.0.0.1:8000 run

$ php artisan serve
